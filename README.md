# Boston Housing Deep Learning
 Project

In this project I had to build 25 different variations of neural networks to determine which variation resulted in the lowest validation loss for the Boston housing dataset. To do this I used 5 network structures and for each structure I would use 5 optimizers. For example, the first network structure had 8 dense layers (2048 neurons, 1024 neurons, 512 neurons, 256 neurons, 128 neurons, 64 neurons, 32 neurons, and 1 neuron). This first network structure also utilized dropouts in between the last three layers. I then would run the network structure using 5 different optimizers (Adadelta, Adam, RMSProp, SGD, ADAMax). I used these 5 optimizers across all 5 network structures which resulted in 25 variations. Each test was run using 250 epochs. The result of these tests was that across 4 of the 5 network structures ADAMax was the best optimizer however ADAM had the best individual reduction in training loss. This project was extremely interesting to me. As someone who is studying computer science and finance, I found the ability to build a deep learning model to predict median value of homes to be extremely interesting. To run this program all one would have to do is click the open in colab button and click run. A person wishing to change the network structure would just need to uncomment out network layers to add more layers.
